# 🔐 **Predictive Dynamic Authentication System (PDAS)**  
### *Enhancing Cybersecurity with Dynamic Authentication*

## 📌 **Overview**

PDAS is a cybersecurity system designed to improve authentication security by replacing traditional static passwords with **time-sensitive, dynamically generated credentials**. Using **predictive algorithms**, it enhances security against threats such as:

✔ **Brute force attacks**  
✔ **Phishing attempts**  
✔ **Credential stuffing**
